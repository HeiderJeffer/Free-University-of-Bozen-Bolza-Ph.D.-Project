# Motivation
To change the current state of HCI and fill the existing gap by addressing new challenges in Sustainable IoT devices and their interaction with end-users, such as children, teens. And to contribute new methodology reflects the child activities and IoT Green devices. Thus, it will enrich HCI knowledge and encourage the children with their parents to be more involved in sustainable IoT devices. 
# Discussion of the State of the art 
From healthcare (Quy et. al., 2022), agriculture (Quy et. al., 2022), smart factories (Mark et. al. 2021), to even smart cities (Tak Kit, 2022) the latest research on IoT devices are being put to good use across industries. And even though applications of IoT devices have been reasonably accepted in several sectors of our society, one thing that is overlooked in the interaction studies with children and teenagers. Today's children are being exposed to technology more than any generation before us, hence the way they interact with them varies a lot from older generations. Current research focus mostly on the advanced application of IoT devices for monitoring and protecting children (Salama et. al. 2022, Heng et. al., 2022), however, little is researched on the way they must be developed for future generations, keeping sustainability and a positive experience in mind. Therefore, we take this goal to address this gap towards a sustainable development of IoT devices for future generations.
Aims and Objectives of your research 
The research objective is to use HCI tools to develop a strategy to measure, investigate and test the end-users interaction with sustainable IoT devices. This study aims to investigate the user experience with IoT devices. This study aims to clarify the interaction challenges between the users and the IoT modern technologies. This study seeks to examine the hardware and the software of IoT devices that effect the interaction between the users and the IoT technologies. 

# Research Question
Connect the average end-users around the globe with IoT modern technology to speed up the earth's transformation to the sustainable limit.

RQ1: Why do average end-users fail to interact with the Sustainable IoT device  

RQ2: How to optimize the interaction between IoT & End-users

RQ3: Privacy & security prevent IoT to achieve a sustainable future

RQ4: Users’ psychological & physical challenges with Sustainable IoT device

RQ5: IoT Global compatibility a risk slowing down the Earth's transformation to a sustainable level 


This research aims to investigate the end-users' interaction with the machine to come up with a strategy that gives a guideline to the designers & developers to design sustainable IoT devices based on users' experiences.


# Discussion of research methodology 

At the beginning, the first thing we would have to look at is the research gap present in the field. Based on that, we can devise methodologies to address the research gap. However, in any case, at the present moment I envision to contribute a new methodology and strategy to collect and analyze data related to the research question, first and foremost, and then use these data to build a model to reflect the child persona and reflect how the child interacts with the IoT sustainable devices.

I would further research into optimizing the IoT devices as hardware and software entities, to provide conclusive evidence as to how they can be manufactured at the root-level to improve the interact-ability with children and teens. This will give us guidelines with new way of thinking for the designers, the developers, and researchers to design and develop sustainable IoT devices that reflect the child's characters and open the door to the new researchers to investigate further. This study will benefit the IoT researchers, expanding their knowledge to accommodate children and teens in the ecosystem of modern sustainable technologies related to the field of Human Computer Interaction. There are several aspects of Sustainability that can be further addressed in relation to the IoT devices in general, to address the overall sustainable challenges facing the future generations. Hence, an overlapping of methodologies and techniques from related fields must also be considered.
